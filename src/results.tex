\textbf{Placeholder for results section.}
Should also mention the setup of cluster actually used.\\

The output of execution of the 125 signal hypothesis patches from the published analysis of a search for electroweakinos with the ATLAS detector using the full Run-2 dataset of \(139~\ifb\) of \(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text{TeV}\) proton-proton collision data~\cite{SUSY-2019-08} (ATLAS SUSY 1Lbb) is shown in \Cref{lst:funcX_demo_output}.
By orchestrating \pyhf{} fits packaged as \funcX{} functions across 70 worker nodes \funcX{} is able to download the \pyhf{} pallet containing the signal patches from HEPData~\cite{ATLAS_SUSY_1Lbb_pallet}, start \funcX{} worker nodes, send patched workspaces to each worker, fit the workspace and return the results with a wall time of just over two minutes.
\TODO{CLARIFY AND REVISE THIS.}\\
