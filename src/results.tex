\section{Scaling of likelihood fits}\label{sec:results}
%
The output of execution of the 125 signal hypothesis patches from~\cite{SUSY-2019-08} is shown in \Cref{lst:funcX_demo_output}.
Summary results for multiple trials are given in \Cref{table:performance}.
By orchestrating \pyhf{} fits packaged as \funcX{} functions across 70 worker nodes \funcX{} is able to download the \pyhf{} pallet containing the signal patches from HEPData~\cite{ATLAS_SUSY_1Lbb_pallet}, start \funcX{} worker nodes, send patched workspaces to each worker, fit the workspace and return the results with a wall time of just over two minutes.
\TODO{CLARIFY AND REVISE THIS.}\\
