\subsection{\pyhf{}}\label{subsec:pyhf}

Through adoption of open source "tensor" computational Python libraries, \pyhf{} is able to leverage tensor calculations to outperform the traditional C++ implementations on data from real LHC analyses.
\funcX{} is able to create and register a service endpoint on HPC systems that interfaces with native schedulers.
End users are able to register functions through a Python API and then scalebly execute workloads, with demonstrated use of scaling to more than 100,000 workers.
We have demonstrated use of \funcX{} to orchestrate \pyhf{} to simultaneously fit 125 signal hypotheses in the parameter space of a published LHC physics analysis with a wall time of under 3 minutes.\\

Great stuff.~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-029}
