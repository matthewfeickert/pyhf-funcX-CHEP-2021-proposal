\caption{Scaling performance on RIVER for analysis fits over 10 trials compared to a single RIVER node. The reported wall fit time is the mean wall fit time of the trials. The uncertainty on the mean wall time corresponds to the standard deviation of the wall fit times. The number of worker nodes used is approximate as per-run reporting is not available.}
