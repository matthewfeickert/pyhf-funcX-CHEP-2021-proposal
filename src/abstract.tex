Abstract goes here

In High Energy Physics there is motivation to perform statistical inference required for analysis of data from the Large Hadron Collider on High Performance Computing environments, which can pose problems with orchestration and efficient scheduling.
The combination of the pure-Python libraries \pyhf{} and \funcX{} reduces the common problem in HEP analyses of performing statistical inference with binned models, that would traditionally take multiple hours and bespoke scheduling, to an on-demand (fitting) function as a service that can scalable execute across workers in just a few minutes, offering reduced time to insight and inference.
