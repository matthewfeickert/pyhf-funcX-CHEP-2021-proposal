\subsection{Current and Future FaaS Analysis Facilities}\label{subsec:FaaS_analysis_facilities}

Through the capabilities of \funcX{} and the fitting performance and declarative nature of \pyhf{} there is opportunity to create a fitting FaaS analysis facility blueprint for leveraging the scaling potential at HPC centers and dedicated hardware acceleration resources.
The blueprint can then be replicated in deployment at HPC centers with available resources and allocation.
\Cref{fig:infrastructure_perspective} shows possible cyberinfrastructure and system design prospects, from the viewpoints of developers and uses, to create a deployment of the blueprint.
As a demonstration of the ability to reduce the time to insight such facilities would offer, we use the RIVER HPC system's~\cite{RIVER_HPC} deployment of \funcX{} to simultaneously evaluate the 125 signal hypothesis patches from the published analysis of a search for electroweakinos with the ATLAS detector using the full Run-2 dataset of \(139~\ifb\) of \(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text{TeV}\) proton-proton collision data~\cite{SUSY-2019-08} with \pyhf{}.
RIVER is able to use \funcX{}'s Slurm task execution provider to leverage the 120 VM cluster for batch jobs.
Each pair of VMs share a hardware node with two Intel Xeon E2650 v3 processors (24 cores), 16 x 16GB TruDDR4 Memory (256GB), two 800GB SATA MLC SSD's (1.6TB), and a 10GigE network --- providing an excellent testing grounds for scaling workflows.
