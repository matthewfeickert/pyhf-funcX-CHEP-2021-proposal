\subsection{Future FaaS Analysis Facilities}\label{subsec:FaaS_analysis_facilities}
\TODO{Probably come up with a better subsection name}

Through the capabilities of \funcX{} and the fitting performance and declarative nature of \pyhf{} there is opportunity to create a fitting FaaS analysis facility blueprint for leveraging the scaling potential at HPC centers and dedicated hardware acceleration resources.
The blueprint can then be replicated in deployment at HPC centers with available resources and allocation.
\Cref{fig:infrastructure_perspective} shows possible cyberinfrastructure and system design prospects, from the viewpoints of developers and uses, to create a deployment of the blueprint.
As a demonstration of the ability to reduce the time to insight such facilities would offer, we use the RIVER HPC system's~\cite{RIVER_HPC} deployment of \funcX{} to simultaneously evaluate the 125 signal hypothesis patches from the published analysis of a search for electroweakinos with the ATLAS detector using the full Run-2 dataset of \(139~\ifb\) of \(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text{TeV}\) proton-proton collision data~\cite{SUSY-2019-08} with \pyhf{}.
\TODO{Should also mention the setup of cluster actually used.}\\
